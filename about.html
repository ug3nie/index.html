    Description
    My name is Eugenia Emelieze and this is my first attempt at creating a website using css and more.
    This training is going to last for a period of 12 weeks and promises to be very interesting and interactive.
    I look forward to beimg tech savy, creating a comprehensive website and even taking it to the next level and becoming a full developer even though i don't have a background in software.
